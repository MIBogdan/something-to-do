## Overview

**Something To Do** is a simple yet engaging web application that helps users find random activities to do when they are unsure of what to engage in. The app fetches activities from an external API and allows users to filter their search by category and the number of participants. This makes it a great tool for discovering new and fun ways to spend time, whether alone or with others.
